## Great, how the h*ll do I use this?

Download the `.apk` file from the releases page and install it on your Android device.
Boom, you're done. Now choose a radio station, download and listen to it whenever you want.

## This app could be better, how do I contribute?

Fork this repository, make your changes and open a pull request. I'll take a look at it and merge it if it's good.
You should make your pull request as detailed as you can, so I can understand what you're trying to do.

The contribution could be anything, from a bug fix, UI update to a new feature. Just make sure it's good.

## I have a suggestion, how do I tell you?

Open an issue on this repository and I'll take a look at it.

## Other boring questions and answers

### Why is this app so ugly?

I'm not a designer, I'm a developer. I don't know how to make things look good. If you want to make it look good, you
can contribute to the project.

### Why is this app so slow?

I'm not a good developer, I'm a bad developer ok? Is that what you want to hear? If you want to make it faster, you can
contribute to the project.

### This app is buggy as sh*t, why?

I'm still working on it and I don't have a lot of time and devices to test it on. If you want to fix the bugs, you can
contribute to the project.
Or you can report the bugs, and I'll try to fix them.

### Why is this app so big?

The app is big because it contains all the radio stations that you have downloaded.
